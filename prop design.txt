prop design:

20 N of thrust for cruise

380 N of thrust for hover (use FM for efficiency)

-model for cruise
-get both rseq and vseq (and aseq for the heck of it, J=V/nD)
-find the RPM for 380N of thrust on rseq
-use vseq to see if efficiency is maintained from 0-30 m/s

J = V(1) / n(from RPM from rseq) D(set)

find aseq sweep where J = the vaule above for hover
take that power and thats the power


-get the rpm from rseq
-

-get vseq all the way down from 0-40 with increments of 1 (get the power and thrust and you're good to go
